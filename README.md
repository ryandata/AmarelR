Amarel is the major High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster available to Rutgers faculty, students, and staff.

The Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC) supports Amarel and provides their own specialized workshops and training.  See their events and workshops at

## Introduction

This workshop introduces some of the details of running on the Amarel cluster, but its focus is a gentle overview of machine learning, using R as the primary tool for analysis.  By working on the Amarel cluster, we use a genuinely "big" dataset as our example, and explore where HPC methods are necessary to handle the data effectively.

## Data

Our primary data example is an 8GB dataset of NYC traffic tickets.  See
